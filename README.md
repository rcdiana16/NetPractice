## NetPractice
- This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by diramire

## Description
- This project is made to explore how configurated small-scale networks, focusing on IP addressing and routing.

## Instructions
- Open the training interface by launching the index.html file in a web browser.
- Each level presents a network diagram that must be correctly configured.
- Configure IP addresses, subnet masks, gateways, routers, and switches as required.
- After completing a level, export the configuration using the provided export option.
- Repeat the process until all levels are completed.

## Resources
- I used the netx links to undertand and resolve this excersice:

## Concepts studied:

- TCP/IP addressing: Assigns unique IP addresses to devices so they can communicate within a network.
- Subnet masks: Define which part of an IP address identifies the network and which part identifies the host.
- Default gateway: Specifies the device that forwards traffic from a local network to external networks.
- Routers and switches: Routers connect different networks, while switches connect devices within the same network.
- OSI layers: A conceptual model that explains how data travels through a network in seven distinct layers.
- Basic routing and network topology: Describe how networks are structured and how data is routed between devices.

## Submission
- Export 10 configuration files, one per level.
- Place all exported files at the root of the repository.
- Only the required configuration files should be submitted.
